# Recognizing Online Threats

Recognizing online threats is an important part of staying safe on the internet. Many cyber attacks rely on tricking users rather than exploiting technical weaknesses. This page explains common types of online threats and how to identify warning signs.

## 1. Phishing Attempts

Phishing attacks try to convince users to reveal sensitive information such as passwords, banking information, or personal details. They often appear as emails or messages that look legitimate.

Common signs of phishing include:

- Unexpected messages asking you to verify information  
- Urgent language pressuring you to act quickly  
- Suspicious links or attachments  
- Sender addresses that do not match the organization  
- Poor grammar, formatting, or unusual tone  

Always check the sender, the link address, and whether the message makes sense before clicking anything.

## 2. Fake or Unsafe Websites

Some websites are designed to imitate real services or steal information.

Warning signs include:

- URLs with extra characters or misspellings  
- Websites without HTTPS in the address bar  
- Pages that ask for login information immediately  
- Low quality images, inconsistent design, or broken elements  
- Offers that seem too good to be true  

If a site feels suspicious, double check the URL or avoid entering information.

## 3. Malicious Downloads

Malware can be delivered through downloads that appear harmless.

Examples include:

- Unsolicited email attachments  
- Files with unusual or double extensions such as invoice.pdf.exe  
- Fake software update prompts  
- Downloads that begin automatically  
- Files from untrusted websites  

If you did not actively choose to download the file, you should not open it.

## 4. Unsecure Networks

Public WiFi networks, such as those in airports or cafes, can expose your traffic to others on the same network.

Risks include:

- Attackers intercepting unencrypted browsing  
- Fake WiFi networks designed to capture information  
- Redirecting traffic to unsafe websites  

You can reduce these risks by using a VPN, avoiding sensitive logins on public WiFi, and confirming you are connecting to the correct network.

## 5. Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks target human behavior instead of technical systems. Attackers may pretend to be an employer, a service provider, or someone in authority.

Common warning signs include:

- Requests for confidential information  
- Messages claiming an emergency that requires immediate action  
- Unexpected phone calls or emails asking for login details or codes  
- Attempts to build trust quickly  

Legitimate companies do not ask for passwords or multi-factor authentication codes through email or phone calls.

## Summary

Online threats often rely on deception rather than complex technical attacks. By checking links carefully, avoiding unexpected downloads, being cautious on public WiFi, and watching for suspicious requests, users can avoid many common risks.

# Final Recomendations
As an IT student attending Mizzou working on my capstone, me and my team are passionate about protecting users from cybersecurity threats. We developed a free online tool called [ThreatKit](https://threatkit.ddns.net/), which is designed to help users identify common threats. The website includes a password strength tester, malicious link checker, phishing detector, and malware checker. A tutorial is provided on the homepage for an overview on how to use the website which uses AI to analyze common threats. The tool is not meant to be trusted with 100% certainty but rather help users make empowered choices when identifying threats.
