# Understanding Online Threats

Before learning how to protect yourself, it helps to understand the common digital threats that users face online:

## 1. Tracking & Data Collection
Across the internet, companies and advertisers use tools to monitor what users do online.

Websites often use:
- Cookies  
- Third-party trackers  
- Behavioral analytics 
 
These systems follow users across the web to build detailed profiles.

### Why It Matters
Tracking allows companies to:
- Build detailed profiles of you  
- Predict your behavior  
- Personalize ads and content  
- Sell your data to third parties  

Even legitimate sites participate in this ecosystem.


## 2. Malicious Ads ("Malvertising")
Malvertising is one of the most common ways users accidentally encounter harmful content.

### What Malvertising Looks Like
Even on reputable websites, ads may:
- Redirect you to fake login pages  
- Attempt to download malware  
- Show fake “virus alerts”  
- Trigger scam pop-ups  

### Why It's Dangerous
Attackers purchase ad space cheaply and inject malicious code. You don’t even need to *click* the ad—  
**some malicious ads can infect systems just by loading on the page.**

This is why ad blockers dramatically increase safety.

## 3. Phishing Attacks
Phishing tries to trick users into revealing sensitive info, such as:
- Passwords  
- Credit card numbers  
- MFA codes  
- Social Security numbers  

### How Phishing Usually Appears
- Fake login emails  
- “Your package could not be delivered” messages  
- Fake job offers  
- Urgent banking alerts  
- Fake password reset emails  

### Red Flags
- Poor grammar or formatting  
- Slightly misspelled URLs  
- Requests for personal information  
- Unexpected file attachments  

Phishing remains the #1 cause of data breaches globally. 

They often appear as fake emails or fake login pages.

## 4. Unsecure Networks
Public Wi-Fi—like in airports, hotels, or coffee shops—is one of the most common sources of digital risk.

### Why Public Wi-Fi Is Dangerous
Attackers on the same network can:
- Intercept unencrypted traffic  
- See visited websites  
- Steal login credentials  
- Inject malicious content into pages  
- Set up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot and impersonate real ones  


## 5. Malware
Malware refers to software designed to harm a system or steal information.

### Common Types of Malware
- **Viruses:** Spread between files and programs  
- **Trojans:** Disguised as legitimate software  
- **Spyware:** Collects private information  
- **Adware:** Displays unwanted ads and tracks activity  
- **Ransomware:** Locks your files and demands payment  
- **Keyloggers:** Record everything you type  

### How Malware Spreads
- Malicious downloads  
- Fake software updates  
- Email attachments  
- Compromised websites  
- USB drives  
- Cracked/pirated software  

### Why People Fall for It
Attackers disguise malware as:
- PDFs (“invoice”, “resume”, “shipping label”)  
- Free software  
- “Video codecs”  
- Browser update prompts  
- Gaming mods  

If you didn’t intentionally download something, **don’t open it.**
